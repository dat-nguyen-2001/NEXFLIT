### Future development

As the web is developed by only one developer (me),due to the limited time, knowledge and resources, it could not serve full features of a movie webapp like real Netflix, AppleTV, etc. In the future, by updating new technologies as well as when there's demand, I'll add some more features to the app:

1. Change from the open API to my own database and APIs.
2. Allow user to setup payment with Stripe
